        Hopefully you came to this website to learn a bit more about me, a made this as a nice personal landing page
        that could be more customizable than my résumé or my GitHub.
        If you do want a print-ready version of my résumé, you can find that <a href="/resume/jayresume.pdf">here</a>.

        My degrees say Mechanical Engineer, but all of the work that I've done has been in software.
    </p>

    <h2>UW–Madison</h2>

    <p>
        I'm currently a Masters student in Mechanical Engineering at UW–Madison, graduating in May 2021.
        I work in Dan Negrut's Simulation Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) working on leveraging high-performance parallel
        computing to improve the speed of our physics simulations.
        I'm writing my thesis on the use of new integration and representation techniques to speed up multi-body
        dynamics solvers.

    <h4>SynChrono module</h4>
    <p>
        In many autonomous vehicle simulations, you don't care what happens if two cars collide -
        that would be bad so you just end the simulation.
        In SynChrono we take advantage of that fact and split a simulation of many Chrono::Vehicles across multiple MPI
        ranks.
        This let us scale from running ~1 vehicles in real-time to running ~100 vehicles in real-time.
        The code is <a href="https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono">in the Chrono repository</a>, and a longer
        description is <a
            href="https://sbel.wisc.edu/2020/03/03/synchrono-a-multi-agent-simulation-framework-for-robotics-and-autonomous-vehicle-applications/">on
            our lab website</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Papers</h4>

    Hopefully more exciting things here soon. I've submitted papers to ICRA, IMSD, blah, blah, and presented on mostly
    SynChrono-related lab research at x, y and z.

    <h2>Epic</h2>

    <p>
        I joined Epic in August 2017 as a hybrid project manager and software developer on the interfaces team.
        As a software developer I wrote a new API for processing data through Epic's interfaces.
        As a project manager I helped manage Epic's first install that used a new fast-release paradigm.
