        <h3>SynChrono Module</h3>

        <p>
            In many autonomous vehicle simulations, you don't care what happens if two cars collide -
            it's precisely the situation that you're trying to avoid.
            In SynChrono we take advantage of that fact and split a simulation of many Chrono::Vehicles across multiple
            MPI
            ranks.
            This let us scale from running ~1 vehicles in real-time to running ~100 vehicles in real-time.
            The code is <a href="https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono">in the Chrono repository</a>, and a longer
            description is <a
                href="https://sbel.wisc.edu/2020/03/03/synchrono-a-multi-agent-simulation-framework-for-robotics-and-autonomous-vehicle-applications/">on
                our lab website</a>.

        <h3>Multibody Dynamics in the rA Formulation</h3>

        <p>
            A problem analogous to mapping the two-dimensional surface of the Earth to a flat piece of paper shows up in
            multi-body dynamics, only in three dimensions.
            Imagine you're walking the surface of the Earth while someone tells you where to go with cardinal directions
            (North, East, ...).
            At some point however you arrive at the North Pole.
            Now they can no longer tell you to go North, West or East, the only valid direction is South!
            Where they could previously tell you to move freely along two axes (North-South and East-West), now they
            just have one.
        </p>

        <p>
            In multi-body dynamics, the analogue to "position on the globe" is the particular rotation of a
            three-dimensional body (is your coffee cup upside down, tilted...).
            One way to represent this is with <b>Euler Angles</b> (think yaw, pitch and roll), but you'll run into the
            problem above - there will always be states where you can't get the system to change state in a particular
            way.
            The physical version of this problem - <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock#On_Apollo_11">gimbal lock</a> is very really and
            actually impacted the Apollo missions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides working very carefully with euler angles, another solution to the problem is to add a fourth
            variable to describe your system (astronaut Mike Collins jokingly asked mission control for a “fourth gimbal
            for Christmas”). Rather than four angles, a smart way of adding a fourth variable is by using <b>unit
                quaternions</b>. These have the added advantage of having much simpler partial derivative expressions
            than euler angles and so are in many cases preferred.
        </p>

        <p>
            Yet another solution (the <b>rA formulation</b> for now) is to work directly "on the globe" (integrate over
            a Lie space) rather than do any of
            the above conversions "onto a paper map" (to a linear vector space).
        </p>

        <h2>Epic</h2>

        <p>
            I joined Epic in August 2017 as a hybrid project manager and software developer on the interfaces team.
            As a software developer I wrote a new API for processing data through Epic's interfaces.
            As a project manager I helped manage Epic's first install that used a new fast-release paradigm.

            I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering Masters student at UW–Madison, where I've focused on the
            computational aspects of engineering, taking classes in <b>computational fluid dynamics</b>, <b>multibody
                dynamics</b>,
            <b>numerical linear algebra</b> and <b>high-performance computing</b>.
            I graduated from Cornell University in 2017 with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Math. In my
            junior year I studied abroad at École Centrale Paris (now CentraleSupélec), taking classes in <b>nuclear
                engineering</b> and <b>renewable energy</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've written code with <b>C++</b> and <b>MPI</b> (<a
                href="https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono">SynChrono</a>),
            <b>Python</b> and <b>Matlab</b>.
            I've taken courses on parallel computing with <b>CUDA</b> and <b>OpenMP</b>.
            I've created web applications with <b>C#</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
            I'm not limited to just these though - I learned <b>MUMPS</b> while
            working at Epic and functional programming languages like <b>OCaml</b> and <b>Haskell</b> while working on
            <a href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>. I'm sure I will use many more in the future, depending on
            what my work requires.

            Hopefully you came to this website to learn a bit more about me, I made this as a nice personal landing page
            that could be more customizable than my résumé or my GitHub.
            My normal one page résumé is <a href="resume/jayresume.pdf">here</a>.

        <p>
            I'm currently a Masters student in Mechanical Engineering at UW–Madison, graduating in May 2021.
            I work in Dan Negrut's <b>Simulation Based Engineering Lab</b> (<a href="sbel.wisc.edu">SBEL</a>) working on
            leveraging high-performance
            parallel
            computing to improve the speed of our physics simulations.
            I'm writing my thesis on the use of new integration and representation techniques to speed up multi-body
            dynamics solvers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before UW–Madison, I worked for close to two years as a project manager and software developer with
            <b>Epic</b> in Verona, Wisconsin. During my undergrad at <b>Cornell University</b> I spent three summers
            developing web tools for <b>Zetron</b>. After studying abroad at <b>École Centrale Paris</b> (now
            CentraleSupélec), I spent the summer interning at the <b>French Atomic Energy Commision</b> (CEA),
            implementing a simple model for reactor core temperature that would help gut-check more computationally
            intensive models.

            In my free time I play Ultimate with <a href="https://twitter.com/mousetrapulti?lang=en">Madison
