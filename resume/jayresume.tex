\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Simulation Based Engineering Lab}{October \osn{2019} -- Present}{Research Assistant}{Madison, WI}
\item Managed development of SynChrono; an open-source C++ library which parallelizes the physics-based simulation engine Chrono, allowing hundreds of vehicles to operate in real-time. 
\item Prototyped and helped implement a re-write of Chrono::Vehicle's off-road terrain algorithm, speeding it up around 60 times and enabling it to scale to arbitrary terrain sizes.
\item Planned development goals and mentored undergraduates who were contributing to the SynChrono project.
\item Wrote and gave talks on several conference papers and posters, gave technical presentations on design and use of SynChrono.

\begin{rSubsection}{Epic Systems \textnormal{--- Leading vendor of EMR (Electronic Medical Record) software}}{August \osn{2017} -- June \osn{2019}}{Interfaces Developer and Project Manager}{Madison, WI}
\item Developed a new parsing library and several smaller projects for Epic's HL7 pharmacy interfaces.
\item Managed the conversion of Olmsted Medical Center's legacy patient data into Epic as they went live on Epic's EMR on one of the fastest time-lines that Epic has done to date.
\item Managed interface testing and validation for United Regional Health Care System's transition to Epic.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Atomic and Alternative Energies Commission [CEA]}{Summer \osn{2016}}{Fuel Cladding Simulation Intern}{Saclay, France}
\item Modeled the swelling of nuclear reactor fuel cladding in a French fourth generation fast breeder reactor.
\item Created and ran simulations to test different swelling models for the cladding.
\item Summarized simulation findings and results in a French technical report.
\end{rSubsection}

%\begin{rSubsection}{Custom Shoes by 3D Foot Scanning}{Spring \osn{2016}}{Second Year Group Project}{ChÃ¢tenay-Malabry, France}
%\item Created a mounted camera and projector setup along with a desktop application to scan feet and measure key dimensions of the foot.
%\item Worked closely with a startup to ensure that the setup allowed them to quickly create custom-fitted shoes for their company.
%\end{rSubsection}

%\begin{rSubsection}{Minimization Research with Dr.~Donald Taves}{\osn{2014} -- \osn{2017}}{Research Assistant}{}
%\item Presented a paper on the effectiveness of Minimization at the \osn{2016} Joint Statistical Meetings in Chicago
%\item Assisted in the clinical trials research of a leading fluoride expert, by developing a tool to create sample trial groups.
%\item Currently developing and maintaining a program that shows how dishonest investigators can be prevented from creating unbalanced control and treatment groups for clinical trials.
%\item The code is publicly available online with a demo at https://github.com/JayTaves/Minimization
